<p align="center">Data erasure solution for files on deno ü¶ï</p>

## ‚ùì Why

When you delete a file using the `rm` UNIX command or with any software, it only removes direct pointers to the data disk sectors and make the data recovery possible with common software tools.

Permanent data erasure goes beyond basic file deletion commands, which:

1. Allow for selection of a specific standard, based on unique needs,
2. Verify the overwriting method has been successful and removed data across the entire device.

## üî© How It Works

The basic principle is to write files before deletion in order to make recovery harder. With remove-forever, you get to choose the standard that follow your needs. Each one is composed of instructions about how many passes it should perform.

It goes from a simple pass of zeros to a 35 passes algorithm. Remove-forever comes with its own algorithm to ensure your data is safe:

* A pass of cryptographically strong pseudo-random data,
* The file is then renamed,
* Truncated to hide the file size.
* And finally files timestamps are randomized.

## ‚ú® Features

Remove-forever is composed of two parts: a deno module with a straightforward API and a command line interface optimized to delete files on the fly.


* [Choose your standard](#)
* [Create your own standard](#)
  * [on files](#)
  * [on directories](#)
* [Wipe disk (TODO)](#)

## üì¶ CLI Installation

[Deno](https://deno.land/#installation) required.

```shell
deno install --allow-write --allow-read --unstable -n remove https://deno.land/x/remove_forever/cli.ts
```
> **Note**: Due to the use of `Deno.utime` and the confirmation request in the CLI, you will need to use the `--unstable` flag.

## üöÄ Quick Start

If you want your application to delete specific files with a pass of cryptographically strong pseudo-random data, use one of these code snippets:

```ts
import remove from "https://deno.land/x/remove_forever/mod.ts";

await remove("./trash")
await remove("./vault/secret.txt")
```

## üìã Examples

```ts
import { remove, fileStandards, directoryStandards } from "./mod.ts";

const count = await remove("./trash/secret.txt", {
  fileStandard: fileStandards.gutmann.remove,
  directoryStandard: directoryStandards.unsafe.remove,
  ignoreErrors: true,
});

console.log(`Removed ${count} files and folders!`)
```
